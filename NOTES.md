# Notes / TODO

Things to fix or improve later. Check items off as they're done.

## Fixes

- [ ] **`client.get()` wastes a sleep on the last attempt** (`src/riot_client/client.py`)
  When the final attempt gets a 429 or 5xx, `get()` still sleeps (Retry-After or backoff)
  before the loop ends and raises `RuntimeError`, so that wait is pointless.
  Idea: only sleep if there's another attempt left (`attempt < MAX_RETRIES - 1`).
  Add a test first: with `MAX_RETRIES` responses of 500, the last one should not trigger a sleep.

## Data design

- [ ] **Unranked match participants** (still in placements / no ranked games this season)
  Seed players are always ranked (league-v4 only lists ranked players), so `players.lp NOT NULL`
  is correct — checked: 400 players, 0 nulls, 18 with lp = 0 (valid, just placed / demoted).
  But the other 9 players in each match may be unranked: league-v4 by-puuid returns `[]` for them.
  When we store participants' rank/LP (Agent 4), those columns must allow NULL.
  For the model, consider an `is_unranked` feature (1/0) — being unranked is itself a signal
  (placements, returning player, smurf).

- [ ] **Target matches are unbalanced across tiers** (found after the first discovery run, 954 matches)
  Seeds are balanced (40 players/tier), but high-elo players play much more in 14 days:
  MASTER 160, GRANDMASTER 159, CHALLENGER 149, DIAMOND 129 … BRONZE 42.
  Almost half the dataset comes from Master+, which is ~1% of the real player base.
  Options: cap matches per seed_tier when training (sample equally), and/or seed more
  low-elo players. Check this again before training the model.
